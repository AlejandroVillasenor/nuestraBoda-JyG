**Wedding RSVP Website**

This website serves as an RSVP platform for a wedding ceremony, providing details about the event and allowing users to confirm their attendance through a SQL, PHP, and JS-powered attendance management system. The integration of SQL and PHP ensures secure access to the registration table, and all entries are dynamically displayed in the user-authenticated login section.

Utilizing JS, jQuery, and CSS, the website comes to life with various techniques and designs, including animations, a countdown timer for the wedding date, an image viewer, and more. The thoughtful incorporation of these technologies enhances the overall user experience.

Special thanks to the entire DevF team for sharing their expertise during the "Master in Coding" course. The knowledge gained from this experience has been invaluable, contributing to the success of this wedding RSVP project.
